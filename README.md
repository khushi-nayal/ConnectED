# ConnectED

1. Problem Statement
A web application that coordinates the seamless functioning between administration and organizers of events on a university campus. The app tracks and handles the 
permission and requests needed to organize an event while avoiding the bulk of emails that connect all relevant parties.

The project has two main stakeholders (the university admin and the event organizers) and an additional third general stakeholder (students and faculty of the 
university). Most event management systems focus on creating a link between organizers and participants. However, especially in a university setup, a lot of 
prerequisites and permissions are required which needs proper communication between the administration and organizers. Currently, this process is tedious and messy 
with a massive influx of mails, requesting/negotiating/allowing the minutia of the event details. This can create overlaps, miscommunication and is overall, hard to
keep track of. Our project aims to solve this issue to help make the flow of event planning smoother from the back-end.

2. Features:
The university administration can:
    1. Approve/deny event requests and track requests for venue, decoration, issuance of university property.
    2. Manage clashes in case of multiple events on the same day.
    3. Approve budget requests and allocate resources.
    4. Float messages and announcements.

The event organizers can:
    1. View available(approved) venues and date/time slots.
    2. Send in and track requests for organizing an event.
    3. Request material required for the duration of the event (like chairs, tables, lights).
    4. Submit a budget for approval.
    5. Get an idea of the number of people who plan to attend.

The prospective participants of the events (university faculty and students) can:
    1. View the list of all approved events happening at any time along with their venues and slots.
    2. RSVP for the event.

3. Purpose
● Event management and approval systems in organizations like universities require a system that would digitize the entire process so as to reduce redundancy and 
manual paperwork. Such software becomes especially necessary in a University setting where a huge number of events are organized simultaneously every year.
● Where most event management platforms focus solely on creating a link between organizers and participants, our application focuses on bridging the gap between
the University administration and the organizers.
● Each University event requires a lot of prerequisites and permissions which need fast and efficient communication between the administration and organizers. At
present, this process is tedious and messy with a massive influx of mails, requesting/negotiating/allowing the minutia of the event details. This can create
overlaps, miscommunication, delays, and is overall, hard to keep track of.
● The goal of our project is to build an application that would streamline and collate all the prerequisites imperative to the event in one place, thus making the flow 
of event planning smoother from the back-end. The event organizers can file all the approval requests needed for their planned event and the administration can
approve or disapprove those requests depending upon their feasibility. These requests could be concerning the event venue booking, time slot allocation, budget 
allocation, size, miscellaneous items required, etc., so as to accommodate events of all scales. In this way, our software reduces the redundancy of mails and 
in-person meetings to a simple one-tap solution.

4. Scope
The software is developed in view of our Shiv Nadar University, and therefore falls in line with its hierarchy and procedures for event organization. The scope of 
the project is to provide a fully-functioning application which would incorporate all the features discussed in the section
